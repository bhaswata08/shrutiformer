2. Custom LLM Provider Integration: Utilizes Langgraph, Langchain, and zukilang for flexible and customizable language modeling capabilities.
3. Agentic State Management: Efficiently manages and updates the corpus of available sign language classes.
4. Chain of Thought (CoT)-Based LLMChain: Employs CoT for enhanced accuracy in converting input sentences to sign language glosses.
5. Masked Keypoint Animation: Generates masked animated keypoints videos for sign language visualization.
